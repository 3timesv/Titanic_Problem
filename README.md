Problem Statement : To predict whether a passenger survive or not from given features.

Solution Description : 
* Evaluation Metric - F1 score
* Statistical Models used - GLM and Pearson Correlation
* Models fitted for Prediction - >Logistic Regression
                  >K nearest neighbor
                  >Support Vector Machine
                  >Gradient Boosting
                  >XGBoost Classifier
                  >Decision Tree Classifier
                  >Random Forest Classifier

Conclusion : I selected two models based on evaluation metric and using cross validation and the reason for same mentioned in the notebook.
